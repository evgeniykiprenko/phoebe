In this version of the application, we have both a normal UI and Rest API. And we can use them together.
We just need to set a URL:
for UI: localhost/
for RestAPI: localhost/api/{table name}

Curently, the application have two tables: users and roles. 
So you can work with them in this way: localhost/api/users or localhost/api/users/1
