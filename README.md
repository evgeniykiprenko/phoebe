The application is quite simple: you can sign in or sign up, after this, you will able to view other users' information, change your profile photo or information about you. Also, the application provides Sign out and Account deleting ability.

To build the application (on master and other branches) I used PHP, JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Ajax requests, and MVC pattern.
And in the LAB-3 branch, the application was transformed into Rest API.
